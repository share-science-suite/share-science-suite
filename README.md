The **Share Science** suite is a collection of resources that help the scientific community share details about how physical material (e.g. biological entities) are produced and processed, known as provenance. The suite includes three resources:

* [Share Science with Sheets for Google Sheetsâ„¢ (sCubed)](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/share_science_with_sheets_for_google_she/1088810982841) is an add-on for Google Sheets that enables scientists to capture the provenances of physical materials.
* [R/SquareCube](https://aemoore62.github.io/rsquarecube.github.io/) is an R package that complements sCubed to help scientists and their collaborators use information captured in sCubed, namely to share information and inform biological outcomes.
* Square Science is a conceptual, platform-independent framework that targets organizing provenance at different levels of granularity. Square Science underpins both sCubed and R/SquareCube.
